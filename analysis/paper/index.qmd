# Introduction

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: INTRODUCTION - Ken Koon Wong Style

Purpose: Hook with personal learning narrative
Ken's approach:
- "I didn't really know... until I learned"
- Establishes author as learner, not expert
- Creates immediate relatability
- Conversational, humble tone

Keep it SHORT - 2-3 paragraphs max. Save detailed explanations for later.

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
Paragraph 1: Your "I didn't know until..." hook
Paragraph 2: Brief context (the problem you faced)
Paragraph 3: Transition to what you wanted to accomplish
-->

I didn't really know much about [topic] until I [encountered situation/tried to implement it/needed it for project]. Like many data scientists, I thought [initial misconception or assumption]. Turns out, [what you actually discovered].

[Brief context: Why did you need this? What problem were you trying to solve? Keep it personal and specific.]

Here's what I set out to understand:

## Motivations

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: MOTIVATIONS SECTION

Ken Koon Wong always includes a "Motivations" section that explains WHY the topic
matters. This is crucial - it helps readers understand if YOUR problem is THEIR problem.

Make it personal and specific:
- Don't just say "optimization is important"
- Say "I was frustrated that my analysis took 3 hours to run on a 2M row dataset"

EXAMPLE:
**Why explore [topic]?**
- [Personal reason 1]: I had a specific problem (e.g., "My plots looked ugly")
- [Practical need 2]: Gap in my workflow (e.g., "I had no systematic way to X")
- [Learning goal 3]: Skill I wanted to develop (e.g., "I'd only used Y, never Z")
- [Curiosity 4]: Interesting question (e.g., "I wondered if X was faster than Y")
-->

**Why explore [topic]?**
- [Personal reason 1: specific problem you faced]
- [Practical need 2: gap in your workflow]
- [Learning goal 3: skill you wanted to develop]
- [Curiosity 4: interesting question you had]

## Objectives

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: OBJECTIVES SECTION

Clear, numbered goals. Ken's style.

Make them SPECIFIC and MEASURABLE where possible:
- BAD: "Learn about modeling"
- GOOD: "Fit a linear regression, compare R², and identify which variables predict MPG"

This section should match what you actually accomplished in the post.
The reader uses this as a mental roadmap of what they'll learn.
-->

**What I wanted to accomplish:**
1. [Specific, measurable objective 1]
2. [Specific, measurable objective 2]
3. [Specific, measurable objective 3]
4. [Stretch goal or advanced concept]

**Disclaimer:** I'm documenting my learning process here. If you spot errors or have better approaches, please let me know.

<!-- ============================================================================
AMBIANCE IMAGE 1 (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
============================================================================

Large format image for visual rhythm. Place after introductory section.

SIZING: width: 100%, height: auto (or ~500px for consistent spacing)
PURPOSE: Break up dense introductory text, maintain reader engagement
CONTENT: Should relate to topic but can be more atmospheric/creative

EXAMPLES:
- Overhead desk setup photo
- Code editor screenshot
- Data visualization in action
- Office/workspace ambiance
- Topic-related artwork
============================================================================ -->

![Atmospheric image to maintain visual engagement - replace with relevant scene](media/images/penguin-hero.jpg){.img-fluid}

<!-- ============================================================================
PREREQUISITES AND SETUP SECTION
============================================================================ -->

# Prerequisites and Setup

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: PREREQUISITES - Ken's Style

Keep it minimal and conversational. Show the code first, explain briefly.
Don't overwhelm with requirements.

For ZZCOLLAB blog posts, data should be ALREADY PREPARED by scripts.
So this section should just show how to LOAD the prepared data and utilities.

DO NOT include inline data cleaning here - that's in 01_prepare_data.R

EXAMPLE:
- Load libraries (from renv automatically installed)
- Load prepared data from CSV: read_csv("data/derived_data/...")
- Load utility functions: source("R/plotting_utils.R")
- Display basic structure to confirm loaded correctly
-->

Here's what you'll need to follow along:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install packages if needed (renv should have handled this)
# But just in case:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "knitr", "patchwork"))
```

```{r}
#| label: setup-libraries
#| eval: false
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(patchwork)
source("R/plotting_utils.R")  # Load custom utility functions

# Setup theme and colors
setup_plot_theme()
colors <- get_analysis_colors()

# Load PREPARED data (generated by 01_prepare_data.R)
# This data includes derived variables and transformations
mtcars_clean <- read_csv("data/derived_data/mtcars_clean.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

**Background:** Basic R and ggplot2 familiarity helpful but not required. I'll explain concepts as we go!

![Foundational concepts and theoretical frameworks](media/images/penguin-hero.jpg){.img-fluid width=100% style="margin: 2rem 0;"}

# What is [Topic/Concept]?

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION

Ken often includes a "What is X?" section explaining concepts in plain language.

STRUCTURE:
1. Start with simple definition (1 sentence)
2. Use analogy or comparison (helps understanding)
3. Give concrete example (makes it real)
4. Keep it brief (2-4 sentences total)
5. THEN show the code

Purpose: Readers without domain expertise should understand the concept.

EXAMPLE FOR "LINEAR REGRESSION":
"Linear regression is a method for understanding how one variable depends on
another - kind of like fitting a straight line through a scatter plot of points.
Imagine you're trying to predict someone's height based on their parents'
heights: you'd draw a line through data points, then use that line to make
predictions for new people. That's what linear regression does."
-->

Before diving into code, let's clarify what [topic] actually means. [Simple, plain-language explanation of the concept. Use an analogy if helpful.] In practice, this means [concrete example or application].

# Getting Started: Initial Exploration

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: FIRST ANALYSIS SECTION

This is where the real analysis begins!

STRUCTURE:
- CODE FIRST (show it)
- OUTPUT (display results)
- BRIEF INTERPRETATION (2-4 sentences)

Ken's ratio: ~40% code, 60% explanation. Don't explain every line of code.
Assume reader can understand basic R - focus on the "why" and "what does this mean"

INCLUDE SUMMARY TABLE: Show key statistics from prepared data
-->

```{r}
#| label: data-overview
#| eval: false
# Display structure of prepared data
glimpse(mtcars_clean)
```

Okay, so we have 32 cars with 11 variables. Let's examine the data characteristics.

```{r}
#| label: summary-stats
#| eval: false
# Key summary stats
summary_table <- mtcars_clean %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mpg_mean = round(mean(mpg), 1),
    mpg_sd = round(sd(mpg), 1),
    hp_mean = round(mean(hp), 0),
    hp_sd = round(sd(hp), 0)
  )

kable(summary_table,
      col.names = c("N", "MPG Mean", "MPG SD", "HP Mean", "HP SD"),
      caption = "Summary Statistics: Motor Trend Car Data")
```

Not too shabby! Average fuel efficiency is 20.1 MPG with quite a bit of variation (SD = 6.0).

# Exploring the Data

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: RESULTS VISUALIZATION SECTION

Here's where your pre-generated figures come in!
See analysis/scripts/03_generate_figures.R for how these were created.

PATTERN:
1. Load results from analysis/data/derived_data/
2. Display pre-generated figure with caption
3. Brief interpretation (what do we learn?)

FIGURE SIZING:
- Main analysis figures: width = "100%" (full width)
- Captions should be descriptive and in-line with data interpretation
- Alt text should be detailed for accessibility

DON'T: re-create these figures inline (they're already generated!)
DO: reference the pre-generated files and focus on interpretation
-->

Let's visualize these patterns. I pre-generated these figures using analysis/scripts/03_generate_figures.R:

```{r}
#| label: eda-overview
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of fuel efficiency across the dataset. Left: Histogram showing MPG distribution. Right: Boxplots of MPG by cylinder count reveal engines with more cylinders tend to have lower fuel efficiency."
#| fig-alt: "Two-panel figure: left shows histogram of MPG distribution ranging from ~10-35 mpg, right shows boxplots for 4, 6, and 8 cylinder vehicles"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/eda-overview.png")
```

Wow, that's a clear pattern! Cars with fewer cylinders are way more fuel-efficient.

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: AMBIANCE IMAGE 2 (OPTIONAL)

Another atmospheric image to maintain visual engagement.
Place after first major figure section.

This creates rhythm: text → figure → ambiance image → text → figure

SIZING: width: 100%, height: auto
PURPOSE: Mental break, maintain engagement, visual balance
============================================================================ -->

![Visual break - another atmospheric image maintaining engagement](media/images/penguin-hero.jpg){.img-fluid}

## Looking for Relationships

```{r}
#| label: correlation-analysis
#| eval: false
# Find strongest correlations with MPG
correlations <- cor(mtcars_clean %>% select(where(is.numeric))) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("var1") %>%
  pivot_longer(-var1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "correlation") %>%
  filter(var1 == "mpg", var2 != "mpg") %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(correlation)))

# Display top 5
kable(correlations %>% head(5),
      caption = "Top 5 Correlations with MPG (fuel efficiency)")
```

🔍 Weight has the strongest correlation with MPG (r = -0.87). Let's visualize that relationship:

```{r}
#| label: correlation-plot
#| fig-cap: "Strong negative relationship between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency. Heavier cars consistently get worse mileage, regardless of cylinder count. The fitted regression line (dashed) shows the overall trend."
#| fig-alt: "Scatter plot with vehicle weight (x-axis, 1000-5500 lbs) vs MPG (y-axis, 10-35 mpg), colored by cylinder count (4/6/8 cyl), with fitted regression line"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/correlation-plot.png")
```

Interesting! Heavier cars consistently get worse mileage. Makes sense when you think about it 🚗

# Building a Model

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: MAIN ANALYSIS SECTION

This is the heart of your post! Show your model results and interpretation.

STRUCTURE:
1. Load pre-computed model results from CSV files
2. Display results in clean tables (using knitr::kable)
3. Brief interpretation
4. Show pre-generated model visualization

KEY PRINCIPLE: Results were computed by 02_fit_models.R
You're just presenting and interpreting them here.

RESULT TABLES:
- Model coefficients with confidence intervals
- Model metrics (R², F-stat, p-value)
- Any diagnostic summaries

AVOID:
- Re-fitting models inline (wastes time, breaks reproducibility)
- Long code chunks (show the figure, not the code to generate it)
- Unexplained statistics (briefly interpret each result)
============================================================================ -->

Let me fit a simple linear model to quantify this relationship:

```{r}
#| label: load-model-results
#| eval: false
# Load pre-computed model results from 02_fit_models.R
model_coef <- read_csv("data/derived_data/model_coefficients.csv",
                       show_col_types = FALSE)
model_metrics <- read_csv("data/derived_data/model_metrics.csv",
                         show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| label: model-summary-table
#| eval: false
# Display model coefficients
kable(model_coef %>% select(term, estimate, std.error, p.value, conf.low, conf.high),
      digits = 4,
      caption = "Linear Regression Results: MPG ~ Weight")
```

```{r}
#| label: model-metrics-table
#| eval: false
# Display fit metrics
kable(model_metrics %>% select(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic, p.value, df.residual),
      digits = 4,
      caption = "Model Fit Metrics")
```

**The model explains 75% of the variance (R² = 0.75).** This is a reasonably strong fit. For every 1,000 lbs of weight, we lose about 5.3 MPG (95% CI: [-6.5, -4.1]).

```{r}
#| label: model-visualization
#| fig-cap: "Linear regression fit showing the relationship between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency. The gray band represents the 95% confidence interval around the fitted line. The fit is quite good, explaining 75% of the variance in MPG."
#| fig-alt: "Scatter plot with fitted regression line and gray confidence band, showing negative relationship between weight and MPG"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/model-plot.png")
```

## Making Predictions

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: PRACTICAL APPLICATION

Show how to use your model for something useful.
This helps readers see the real-world value of your analysis.

Include concrete examples with actual numbers.
-->

Let me make some predictions to see how this works in practice:

```{r}
#| label: predictions
#| eval: false
# Predict MPG for different weights
new_data <- tibble(wt = c(2, 3, 4))
model <- readRDS("data/derived_data/simple_model.rds")
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence")

cbind(new_data, predictions) %>%
  kable(digits = 2,
        caption = "Predicted MPG for Vehicles of Different Weights")
```

📝 So a 2,000 lb car gets ~30 MPG, while a 4,000 lb car only gets ~15 MPG. That's quite a difference!

# Checking Our Work

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: DIAGNOSTICS SECTION

Show you've validated your assumptions.
Be transparent about potential issues.

Load pre-generated diagnostic data from model fitting script.
Display residual plots and outlier analysis.
-->

Before we trust these results, let's check if our model assumptions hold up:

```{r}
#| label: load-diagnostics
#| eval: false
# Load pre-computed diagnostics
diagnostics <- read_csv("data/derived_data/model_diagnostics.csv",
                       show_col_types = FALSE)

# Summary
outlier_count <- sum(diagnostics$is_outlier)
cat("Outliers found (>2.5 SD):", outlier_count, "\n")
cat("Residual SE:", round(sqrt(mean(diagnostics$residuals^2)), 2), "MPG\n")
```

**Diagnostic checks:** Found 2-3 potential outliers (>2.5 SD) when running the analysis. These merit investigation but don't substantially affect the overall model fit.

Now let's visualize the residuals to check for patterns:

```{r}
#| label: diagnostics-plot
#| fig-cap: "Residual diagnostic plot showing standardized residuals vs fitted values. The red dashed lines mark ±2 standard deviations. A good model should show residuals randomly scattered around zero with no patterns. We have a few potential outliers but overall the fit looks reasonable."
#| fig-alt: "Scatter plot of standardized residuals (y-axis) vs predicted values (x-axis), with reference lines at -2, 0, +2"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/diagnostics-plot.png")
```

Looks pretty good! No major patterns in the residuals, though we have a couple of potential outliers worth investigating 🔍

## Things to Watch Out For

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: GOTCHAS SECTION

Share what you learned the hard way.
Be conversational and personal.
Help readers avoid your mistakes.

Use first person: "I found that..." "Watch out for..."
-->

A few gotchas I encountered while working on this:

1. **Don't extrapolate too far** - This model works for weights between 1.5-5.5 thousand lbs. Predicting outside that range? Risky!

2. **Correlation ≠ Causation** - Weight correlates with MPG, but there are confounding variables (engine size, aerodynamics, etc.)

3. **Check your assumptions** - Always plot residuals! A good R² doesn't guarantee your model is appropriate.

4. **Small sample size** - We only have 32 cars. Take the confidence intervals seriously!

# What Did We Learn?

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: LESSONS LEARNT - Ken's Signature Section!

This is Ken's trademark section - always included.

STRUCTURE:
- Bullet points of key takeaways
- Tools/packages mastered
- Concepts understood
- Skills developed
- Be specific and actionable

THREE CATEGORIES:
1. Conceptual Understanding (what did you learn about the domain?)
2. Technical Skills (what tools/techniques did you master?)
3. Gotchas and Pitfalls (what could go wrong?)
-->

## Lessons Learnt

Here's what I took away from this exploration:

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Vehicle weight is a strong predictor of fuel efficiency (R² = 0.75)
- Each 1,000 lbs reduces MPG by ~5.3 miles (95% CI: [-6.5, -4.1])
- Cylinder count effects are partially mediated through weight
- Simple models can be surprisingly effective with the right predictor

**Technical Skills:**
- Using `broom::tidy()` for clean model output formatting ✅
- Calculating and interpreting confidence intervals for predictions
- Creating diagnostic plots to validate regression assumptions
- Combining multiple ggplot visualizations with `patchwork`

**Gotchas and Pitfalls:**
- Always check residual plots - R² alone isn't enough!
- Extrapolation beyond data range is dangerous
- Small sample sizes (n=32) require cautious interpretation
- Correlation doesn't prove causation (confounding variables matter)

## Limitations

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: LIMITATIONS - Ken's Style

Be honest and transparent.
Ken acknowledges limitations upfront.
Keep it concise - bullet points work well.

This shows scientific maturity and helps readers know when your findings apply.
-->

This analysis has several limitations to keep in mind:

- **Old data**: mtcars is from 1974 - modern vehicles (hybrids, EVs) behave differently
- **Small sample**: Only 32 observations limits statistical power
- **Missing variables**: Doesn't account for aerodynamics, transmission type, engine tech
- **Simple model**: Single predictor ignores important confounders
- **Limited scope**: Only passenger cars; may not generalize to trucks/SUVs

## Opportunities for Improvement

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES - Another Ken Signature!

Forward-looking section on what could be done next.
- Extensions to try
- Better approaches
- Future directions
- Related analyses

This helps readers see where research/learning could go next.
-->

If I had more time, here's what I'd explore next:

1. **Multiple regression** - Add cylinder count, horsepower, transmission type
2. **Interaction effects** - Does weight impact differ by number of cylinders?
3. **Modern data** - Replicate with 2020+ vehicle data to see how relationships changed
4. **Non-linear models** - Try polynomial regression or splines for better fit
5. **Machine learning comparison** - How does linear regression compare to random forest?
6. **Causal inference** - Use techniques to establish causality, not just correlation

# Wrapping Up

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: CONCLUSION - Ken's Style

Short, friendly, forward-looking.
Ken often invites collaboration and questions.
Acknowledges ongoing learning.
Expresses gratitude.

Keep it brief - 2-3 paragraphs max.
End with 💙 or similar warm closing.
-->

So that's my journey exploring [topic]! We saw that vehicle weight is a powerful predictor of fuel efficiency, accounting for 75% of the variance. The model is simple but effective, though it has limitations worth keeping in mind.

**Main takeaways:**
- Weight strongly predicts MPG (R² = 0.75, β = -5.3)
- Always check model assumptions with diagnostic plots
- Confidence intervals matter, especially with small samples
- Simple models can be surprisingly powerful

I learned a lot working through this, especially about [specific technical skill you gained]. There's definitely room for improvement—adding more predictors, trying non-linear models, and using modern data would all be interesting extensions.

**If you're trying this yourself:**
- Start with exploration before modeling
- Plot your residuals!
- Don't trust high R² blindly
- Report confidence intervals alongside point estimates

Thanks for following along.
