# Introduction

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: INTRODUCTION - Ken Koon Wong Style
Purpose: Hook with personal learning narrative
Ken's approach:
- "I didn't really know... until I learned"
- Establishes author as learner, not expert
- Creates immediate relatability
- Conversational, humble tone
Keep it SHORT - 2-3 paragraphs max
-->

I didn't really know much about [topic] until I [encountered situation/tried to implement it/needed it for project]. Like many data scientists, I thought [initial misconception or assumption]. Turns out, [what you actually discovered] 🤔

[Brief context: Why did you need this? What problem were you trying to solve? Keep it personal and specific.]

Here's what I set out to understand:

## Motivations

<!-- Ken always has a "Motivations" section explaining WHY this matters -->

**Why explore [topic]?**
- [Personal reason 1: specific problem you faced]
- [Practical need 2: gap in your workflow]
- [Learning goal 3: skill you wanted to develop]
- [Curiosity 4: interesting question you had]

## Objectives

<!-- Clear, numbered objectives - Ken's style -->

**What I wanted to accomplish:**
1. [Specific, measurable objective 1]
2. [Specific, measurable objective 2]
3. [Specific, measurable objective 3]
4. [Stretch goal or advanced concept]

**Disclaimer:** I'm documenting my learning process here. If you spot errors or have better approaches, please let me know! 💙

# Prerequisites and Setup

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: PREREQUISITES - Ken's Style
Keep it minimal and conversational
Show the code first, explain briefly
Don't overwhelm with requirements
-->

Here's what you'll need to follow along:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install packages if needed
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "knitr", "patchwork"))
```

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(patchwork)

# Set plotting theme
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 12))

# Custom color palette
custom_colors <- c("#FF6B6B", "#4ECDC4", "#45B7D1", "#96CEB4")
```

**Background:** Basic R and ggplot2 familiarity helpful but not required. I'll explain concepts as we go!

# What is [Topic/Concept]?

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION - Ken's Style
Ken often includes a "What is X?" section explaining concepts in plain language
- Start with simple definition
- Use analogies or examples
- Keep it brief (2-4 sentences)
- THEN show the code
-->

Before diving into code, let's clarify what [topic] actually means. [Simple, plain-language explanation of the concept. Use an analogy if helpful.] In practice, this means [concrete example or application].

# Getting Started: Initial Exploration

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: FIRST SECTION
CODE FIRST, then brief explanation
Ken's ratio: ~40% code, 60% explanation
Keep explanatory text SHORT (2-4 sentences between code blocks)
-->

```{r}
# Load data
data(mtcars)

# Display structure
glimpse(mtcars)
```

Okay, so we have 32 cars with 11 variables. Let's see what we're working with here 🤔

```{r}
# Key summary stats
summary_table <- mtcars %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mpg_mean = round(mean(mpg), 1),
    mpg_sd = round(sd(mpg), 1),
    hp_mean = round(mean(hp), 0),
    hp_sd = round(sd(hp), 0)
  )

kable(summary_table,
      col.names = c("N", "MPG Mean", "MPG SD", "HP Mean", "HP SD"))
```

Not too shabby! Average fuel efficiency is 20.1 MPG with quite a bit of variation (SD = 6.0).

# Exploring the Data

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: BUILD COMPLEXITY - Ken's Style
- CODE → OUTPUT → Brief interpretation
- Use casual expressions: "Wow," "Interesting," "Ouch," "Not too shabby!"
- SHOW results, don't just explain them
- Let the data tell the story
-->

Let's visualize these patterns:

```{r}
# Create distribution plots
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = custom_colors[1], alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of MPG", x = "Miles Per Gallon", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg, fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +
  labs(title = "MPG by Cylinder Count",
       x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Miles Per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Combine plots
combined_plot <- p1 + p2
print(combined_plot)

# Save the plot
ggsave("eda-overview.png", plot = combined_plot, width = 10, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

![Overview of fuel efficiency distributions showing variation across cylinder counts](eda-overview.png){alt='Two-panel figure: left shows histogram of MPG distribution, right shows boxplots of MPG by cylinder count (4, 6, 8 cylinders)'}

Wow, that's a clear pattern! Cars with fewer cylinders are way more fuel-efficient 📊

## Looking for Relationships

```{r}
# Find strongest correlations with MPG
correlations <- cor(mtcars) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("var1") %>%
  pivot_longer(-var1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "correlation") %>%
  filter(var1 == "mpg", var2 != "mpg") %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(correlation)))

# Show top 5
correlations %>% head(5)
```

🔍 Weight has the strongest correlation with MPG (r = -0.87). Let's visualize that relationship:

```{r}
# Plot the relationship
key_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors, name = "Cylinders") +
  labs(title = "Weight vs Fuel Efficiency",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles Per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal()

print(key_plot)
ggsave("correlation-plot.png", plot = key_plot, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

![Scatter plot showing negative relationship between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency](correlation-plot.png){alt='Scatter plot with weight on x-axis and MPG on y-axis, colored by cylinder count, showing negative correlation with fitted line'}

Interesting! Heavier cars consistently get worse mileage. Makes sense when you think about it 🚗

# Building a Model

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: MAIN ANALYSIS - Ken's Style
This is the heart of your post
- CODE → OUTPUT → Brief reaction/interpretation
- Use emoji for emphasis: ✅ ❌ 🤣 🤔 📊
- Label results clearly: "wrong model ❌" vs "correct model ✅"
- React to results: "Wow," "Ouch," "Not bad!"
- Keep explanations SHORT between code blocks
-->

Alright, let's build a simple linear model to quantify this relationship:

```{r}
# Fit the model
simple_model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Get tidy summary
model_summary <- tidy(simple_model, conf.int = TRUE)
model_metrics <- glance(simple_model)

# Display the results
model_summary
glance(simple_model)
```

📊 **Nice! The model explains 75% of the variance (R² = 0.75).** For every 1,000 lbs of weight, we lose about 5.3 MPG (95% CI: [-6.5, -4.1]) ✅

Let's make some predictions to see how this works in practice:

```{r}
# Predict MPG for different weights
new_data <- tibble(wt = c(2, 3, 4))
predictions <- predict(simple_model, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence")

# Combine for display
cbind(new_data, predictions)
```

📝 So a 2,000 lb car gets ~30 MPG, while a 4,000 lb car only gets ~15 MPG. That's quite a difference!

## Model Visualization

```{r}
# Visualize model fit with confidence bands
model_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", fill = "gray80") +
  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors, name = "Cylinders") +
  labs(title = "Linear Model: MPG ~ Weight",
       subtitle = "Gray band shows 95% confidence interval",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles Per Gallon") +
  theme_minimal()

print(model_plot)
ggsave("model-plot.png", plot = model_plot, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

# Checking Our Work

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: DIAGNOSTICS/VALIDATION - Ken's Style
- Show what to watch out for
- Be transparent about issues
- Use casual language
- Emoji for visual breaks
-->

Before we trust these results, let's check if our model assumptions hold up:

```{r}
# Add diagnostic information
mtcars_diagnostics <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    predicted = predict(simple_model),
    residuals = residuals(simple_model),
    std_resid = rstandard(simple_model)
  )

# Check for outliers
outliers <- which(abs(mtcars_diagnostics$std_resid) > 2.5)
```

⚠️ **Diagnostic checks:** Found `r length(outliers)` potential outliers (>2.5 SD). Residual standard error is `r round(sigma(simple_model), 2)` MPG.

Now let's visualize the residuals to check for patterns:

```{r}
# Create diagnostic plot
diag_plot <- ggplot(mtcars_diagnostics, aes(x = predicted, y = std_resid)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-2, 0, 2),
             linetype = c("dashed", "solid", "dashed"),
             color = c("red", "black", "red")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors, name = "Cylinders") +
  labs(title = "Residual Diagnostics",
       x = "Predicted MPG", y = "Standardized Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

print(diag_plot)
ggsave("diagnostics-plot.png", plot = diag_plot, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

![Diagnostic plot showing residual patterns to assess model validity](diagnostics-plot.png){alt='Residual plot with standardized residuals on y-axis and predicted values on x-axis, with reference lines at -2, 0, and +2 standard deviations'}

Looks pretty good! No major patterns in the residuals, though we have a couple of potential outliers worth investigating 🔍

## Things to Watch Out For

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: GOTCHAS - Ken's Style
- Share what you learned the hard way
- Be conversational and personal
- "I found that..." "Watch out for..."
-->

A few gotchas I encountered while working on this:

1. **Don't extrapolate too far** - This model works for weights between 1.5-5.5 thousand lbs. Predicting outside that range? Risky!

2. **Correlation ≠ Causation** - Weight correlates with MPG, but there are confounding variables (engine size, aerodynamics, etc.)

3. **Check your assumptions** - Always plot residuals! A good R² doesn't guarantee your model is appropriate.

4. **Small sample size** - We only have 32 cars. Take the confidence intervals seriously!

# What Did We Learn?

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: LESSONS LEARNT - Ken's Signature Section!
This is Ken's trademark section - always included
- Bullet points of key takeaways
- Tools/packages mastered
- Concepts understood
- Skills developed
- Be specific and actionable
-->

## Lessons Learnt

Here's what I took away from this exploration:

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Vehicle weight is a strong predictor of fuel efficiency (R² = 0.75)
- Each 1,000 lbs reduces MPG by ~5.3 miles (95% CI: [-6.5, -4.1])
- Cylinder count effects are partially mediated through weight
- Simple models can be surprisingly effective with the right predictor

**Technical Skills:**
- Using `broom::tidy()` for clean model output formatting ✅
- Calculating and interpreting confidence intervals for predictions
- Creating diagnostic plots to validate regression assumptions
- Combining multiple ggplot visualizations with `patchwork`

**Gotchas and Pitfalls:**
- Always check residual plots - R² alone isn't enough!
- Extrapolation beyond data range is dangerous
- Small sample sizes (n=32) require cautious interpretation
- Correlation doesn't prove causation (confounding variables matter)

## Limitations

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: LIMITATIONS - Ken's Style
Be honest and transparent
Ken acknowledges limitations upfront
Keep it concise - bullet points work well
-->

This analysis has several limitations to keep in mind:

- **Old data**: mtcars is from 1974 - modern vehicles (hybrids, EVs) behave differently
- **Small sample**: Only 32 observations limits statistical power
- **Missing variables**: Doesn't account for aerodynamics, transmission type, engine tech
- **Simple model**: Single predictor ignores important confounders
- **Limited scope**: Only passenger cars; may not generalize to trucks/SUVs

## Opportunities for Improvement

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES - Another Ken Signature!
Forward-looking section on what could be done next
- Extensions to try
- Better approaches
- Future directions
- Related analyses
-->

If I had more time, here's what I'd explore next:

1. **Multiple regression** - Add cylinder count, horsepower, transmission type
2. **Interaction effects** - Does weight impact differ by number of cylinders?
3. **Modern data** - Replicate with 2020+ vehicle data to see how relationships changed
4. **Non-linear models** - Try polynomial regression or splines for better fit
5. **Machine learning comparison** - How does linear regression compare to random forest?
6. **Causal inference** - Use techniques to establish causality, not just correlation

# Wrapping Up

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: CONCLUSION - Ken's Style
Short, friendly, forward-looking
Ken often invites collaboration and questions
Acknowledges ongoing learning
Expresses gratitude
-->

So that's my journey exploring [topic]! We saw that vehicle weight is a powerful predictor of fuel efficiency, accounting for 75% of the variance. The model is simple but effective, though it has limitations worth keeping in mind.

**Main takeaways:**
- Weight strongly predicts MPG (R² = 0.75, β = -5.3)
- Always check model assumptions with diagnostic plots
- Confidence intervals matter, especially with small samples
- Simple models can be surprisingly powerful

I learned a lot working through this, especially about [specific technical skill you gained]. There's definitely room for improvement—adding more predictors, trying non-linear models, and using modern data would all be interesting extensions.

**If you're trying this yourself:**
- Start with exploration before modeling
- Plot your residuals!
- Don't trust high R² blindly
- Report confidence intervals alongside point estimates

Thanks for following along! 💙
